# âœ… IMPROVED ERROR MESSAGES

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Network Error Detection**
**Before:** Generic "Network error occurred"
**After:** "Unable to connect to server. Please check if the backend is running on port 8000."

### 2. **HTTP Status Code Messages**
- **400:** "Invalid request. Please check your input."
- **401:** "Invalid email or password."
- **403:** "Access denied."
- **404:** "Service not found. Please try again later."
- **500:** "Server error. Please try again later."

### 3. **Registration-Specific Errors**
- **Email exists:** "This email is already registered. Please login instead or use a different email."
- **Username taken:** "This username is already taken. Please try a different name."
- **Password weak:** Shows specific requirement (e.g., "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter")
- **Passwords don't match:** "Passwords do not match. Please make sure both passwords are identical."
- **Name too short:** "Please enter your full name (at least 2 characters)."

### 4. **Login-Specific Errors**
- **Wrong credentials:** "Invalid email or password. Please check your credentials and try again."
- **Inactive account:** "Your account is inactive. Please contact support."
- **Empty fields:** "Please enter both email and password."

### 5. **Password Requirements Hint**
Added helper text under password field:
"Must be 8+ characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a number"

## How to Debug

### If you see "Cannot connect to server"

**Check:**
1. Is backend running? `python start_server.py`
2. Is it on port 8000? Check terminal output
3. Can you access http://localhost:8000/docs?

**Fix:**
```powershell
cd c:\Users\Diya\OneDrive\AutoNote\AutoNote\backend
python start_server.py
```

### If you see "Invalid request"

**Check:**
1. Are all required fields filled?
2. Is email format valid?
3. Does password meet requirements?

**Fix:**
- Full Name: At least 2 characters
- Email: Valid format (user@domain.com)
- Password: 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit

### If you see password validation errors

**Requirements:**
- âœ… Minimum 8 characters
- âœ… At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- âœ… At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- âœ… At least one digit (0-9)

**Valid examples:**
- `MyPass123`
- `Test1234`
- `SecurePass99`
- `Hello2024`
